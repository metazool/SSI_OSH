## An Open Source Hardware Ethos

* Open Science goes hand in hand with Open Source and Data
* But we treat research hardware differently!
* Reproducible, Transparent, Accessible, and Peer Reviewed
* These principles should be embedded in our instruments! 


## Research networks

* Host several workshops across the UK
* Low-cost, low-power sensing devices and networks
* Bring together field researchers and enthusiast makers
* Very participatory, interactive model including prototyping!


## Goals

* Documentation!
  * Of the workshop model, to reproduce it
  * Of discussions and concept designs for sensors
* Sharing practical, hands-on electronics experience
* Build links between enthusiasts and researchers
* Set the scene for future innovation funding to include OSH


## Sites

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* Edinburgh (in either UKCEH or community-run workshop)
* Bristol (in the Bristol Hackspace, hosted by Libby Miller)
* (Cardiff / Bangor / Wallingford)
