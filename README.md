# Software Sustainability and Open Source Hardware

Notes and links supporting an Open Source Hardware themed application to the SSI Fellowship scheme. 

The Fellowship scheme offers participants a Â£4K bursary, intended mainly to be used to organise or participate in workshops and events.

### Micro pitch

A series of workshops bringing together research engineers working on tools for environmental sensor data analysis, and open source hardware and networking enthusiasts working on low-power, low-bandwidth micro devices. Discuss and document potential novel applications while simultaneously engaged in a hands-on prototyping exercises, with most of the workshop budget going towards a small repurposable kit per attendee. Workshops to run over the course of a week (likely in late Spring 2025) in three or four different locations across the UK.
