# Software Sustainability and Open Source Hardware

Notes and links supporting an Open Source Hardware themed application to the SSI Fellowship scheme. 

The Fellowship scheme offers participants a Â£4K bursary, intended mainly to be used to organise or participate in workshops and events.

## Micro pitch - "Open Source Hardware for Environmental Monitoring"

A series of [workshops](WORKSHOPS.md) bringing together research engineers working on tools for environmental sensor data analysis, and open source hardware and networking enthusiasts working on low-power, low-bandwidth micro devices. Discuss and document potential novel applications while simultaneously engaged in a hands-on prototyping exercises, with most of the workshop budget going towards a small repurposable kit per attendee. Workshops to run over the course of a week (likely in late Spring 2025) in three or four different locations across the UK.

## SSI scheme and context

* [SSI Fellowship programme 2025](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/ssi-fellowship-programme-2025-applications-now-open)

This requires a 6 minute recorded voiceover slideshow presentation which includes 2 minutes self-promotion and professional context setting

_Notes to hit_: Better * for better research; reliable, reusable. Essential skills, communities of practise, "supporting the right people". Promote best practises. _Infrastructure_ is in scope. Field sensor nets as Digital Research Infrastructure. FOSS principles apply to hardware (is there an Open Definition moral equivalent?)
Past advocacy and organising work in adjacent fields
"improve research or _computational practise_"
Connection to SSI initiatives and past fellowships on computing environmental sustainability 
"Different backgrounds, new ideas, ambitious" - promising rhetoric... "how are you going to make an impact and where are you going to make it"

For the workshop outline - judgement criteria are its end goals "SMART" and does it demonstrate a clear understanding of the bigger picture in which it's placed

## Prior art 

### Workshops and seminars

* [Wave Farm residency](https://zachpoff.com/artwork/wave-farm-residency-2013/?highlight=hydrophone%20experiments) - 2013 New York State workshop by Zach Poff and N.B. Aldrich, lightweight sensor building, smartphone based
* [Wuthering Bytes / Open Source Hardware Camp](https://wutheringbytes.com/news/2024/open-source-hardware-camp-2024-programme-announced) 2024
* ["The Three Ingredients for Scaling-Up Water Sensor Networks: People, Platform, and Protocols"](https://digitalenvironment.org/cde-webinar-dr-scott-ensign-and-shannon-hicks/) - NERC seminar covering EnviroDIY / WikiWatershed, see below
  
### Labs and Networks

* [Openly Published Environmental Sensing](https://open-sensing.org/) Oregon State, College of Agricultural Sciences. "_From soldering stations to 3D printers to laser cutters, our lab provides the tools necessary for students, professors, and researchers alike to develop tools used locally and worldwide by the ecological science and engineering community._"
* [EnviroDIY](https://www.envirodiy.org/) - Stroud Water Research Center
* [Bristol Wireless](https://www.bristolwireless.net/) - Social enterprise to build a LoRaWAN/IoT backbone for Bristol, evolving from community wifi

### Sampling devices

* [Mayfly](https://www.envirodiy.org/mayfly/) data logger, "comprised of sensors for measuring conductivity, temperature, depth, and turbidity"
* [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) low-cost, full-spectrum acoustic logger, ultrasonic frequencies, underwater plans
