# Open Source Hardware for Environmental Monitoring - Workshops

_Outline of a proposed programme for workshop activity_


## Aims

Bring together field engineers and researchers working on environmental monitoring, with enthusiast makers working on low-cost, low-power open source hardware and local networks.

Create some small-scale prototypes, identify through discussion sensors and sites that would work well for trials; ideally where existing long-term environmental monitoring data and LoRaWAN networks and gateways are already close together.

Document the experience and cumulatively write a blueprint for running an equivalent workshop in other venues.

Workshop attendees (probably no more than 12 per site) are each provided a small starter kit (base board, battery) and a choice of a collection of sensors.

## Location and timing
Series of several workshops, ideally on sequential days during the same week, during late Spring 2025, geographically distributed throughout the UK - either three or four depending on budget and local organising capacity.

* Edinburgh (workshop space in either the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, or the Edinburgh Hacklab in the Summerhall arts complex
* Bristol (Bristol Wireless / Bristol hackspace)
* Cardiff (possible) - existing LoRaWAN network and outreach activity in the farming community
* Wallingford (possible) - in the Engineering Workshop in the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology

## Sessions 

### Morning
* Two short keynote-style introductions offering the highlights of environmental monitoring sensors and of open source hardware and networking
* Poster-style session using the "ConverStations" method - tables rather than presentations, participants rotate around the tables rather than stay in a breakout group

### Afternoon
* Hands-on exercises, discussion of applications while working on assembly and configuration of small prototypes
* Documentation and concluding discussion (whole group editing of notes and links)
