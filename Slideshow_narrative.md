_Note: 6 minute timing requirement is tight, so writing it all out. "1 min. on professional background, 1 min on job role" and implicit networks, 4 mins on proposed Fellowship activity_

Thank you for your consideration! My name is Jo, I'm a software engineer by background and have worked closely with research teams for the past dozen years. In the past I've done a lot of open source geospatial and open data work; 20 years ago, I did a lot of workshop and conference track organising through the Open Knowledge Foundation, for different forms of open access to geographic data including the start of OpenStreetmap.

 I'm now working in a newly established Research Software Engineering team at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, an environmental research not-for-profit that was once part of NERC. Our team's role is to look across different areas of science specialisms, find common ground and build reusable services as part of "digital research infrastructure".

## Concept 

There's a lot of activity there in technology-driven forms of land-based environmental monitoring - "camera traps", sound sensors both above and below ground, the chemical composition of soil, air and water. It's complemented by aerial and satellite sensors, and by lab-based analysis of physical samples. Key to the ethos of UKCEH is investment in open source and open data. There are pockets of hardware innovation, influenced by a wider movement of open science hardware and "citizen science" ecological monitoring projects. 

Buying in proprietary sensors restricts the range of invention. Ease of access to and reuse of computer vision models leads to a "stick a camera on it" approach to monitoring. Bioacoustics is an emerging field of much interest, but people see it as classification of sound features.

I'm making this application to the SSI Fellowship scheme because to draw out the implicit picture of low-cost, low-power, open source options for environmental projects. I'd use the fund to support interactive, hands-on workshops that bring together people from two different worlds that I have a foot in - research experts and field engineers in environmental science, in tune with the practial issues of deployment (like sheep trying to eat your sensors!) - and creative technologists and hobbyist inventors in the network of hackerspaces.

## Workshop outline

* Identify through discussion sensors and sites that would work well for trials
* Create some small-scale prototypes
* Document the experience and cumulatively write a blueprint for re-running the workshop

Workshop attendees (probably no more than 12) are each provided a small starter kit (base board, battery) and a choice of a collection of sensors.

## Location and timing
Series of several workshops, ideally on sequential days during the same week, during late Spring 2025, geographically distributed throughout the UK - either three or four depending on budget and local organising capacity.

* Edinburgh (workshop space in either the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, or the Edinburgh Hacklab in the Summerhall arts complex
* Bristol (Bristol Wireless / Bristol hackspace)
* Cardiff or Bangor (possible) - existing LoRaWAN network and outreach activity in the farming community
* Wallingford (possible) - in the Engineering Workshop in the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology

## Sessions 

### Morning
* Two short keynote-style introductions 
* Poster-style session using the "ConverStations" method - tables rather than presentations, participants rotate around the tables rather than stay in a breakout group

### Afternoon
* Hands-on exercises, discussion of applications while working on assembly and configuration of small prototypes
* Documentation and concluding discussion (whole group editing of notes and links)

## Conclusion

An open source hardware application to an open source software institute may be unexpected, but I think it's natural; applying the same ethod of reproducible, reusable and transparent work that has become the norm for research software, to research hardware, I hope that exposing enthusiast makers to seasoned environmental field engineers will lead to future commercial, as well as community benefits. A blueprint for more workshops will bridge the gap between "citizen science" and institutional data collection practises.
